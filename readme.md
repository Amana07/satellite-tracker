Satellite tracker
=================

Javascript 3D satellite tracker with up-to-date data from CELESTRAK. Uses [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [satellite.js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js). 

Here is a nice screenshot showing the predicted International Space Station orbit through a day. (Side note, [Why doesn't ISS pass over the polar regions?](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5297/why-doesnt-iss-pass-over-the-polar-regions))
